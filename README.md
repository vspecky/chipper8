# Chipper8.rs (Work in Progress)
Chipper8.rs will be a CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter written in Rust. Just a small hobby project for me to learn Rust.  
Thinking of making this a pure CLI, but I might add a GUI too.

## What is CHIP-8?
CHIP-8 is a simple interpreted programming language that was developed by Joseph Weisbecker back in the 1970s for the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 Microcomputers. It was used to create quite a few games too. More information can be found on the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

## What if I wanna do my own implementation?
In that case, you should check out the following two websites :-
- [Cowgod's CHIP-8 reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)  
- [Matthew Mikolay's "Mastering CHIP-8"](http://mattmik.com/files/chip8/mastering/chip8.html)  

Mattmik's website is great for understanding the CHIP-8 language and Cowgod's website is a very concise and helpful reference.
